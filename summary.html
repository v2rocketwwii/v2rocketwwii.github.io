<p>In conclusion, the V2 Missile was a very dangerous weapon. It was virtually unstoppable once launched. More than <i>3,000</i> missiles were launched at Allied powers. It was also dangerous while building it because <i>more people died building it than were killed by the Germans launching the missile at other countries.</i> The Germans were working on the V2 missile for more than 10 years. You could also put multiple dangerous types of warheads on the V2 missile.</p>
