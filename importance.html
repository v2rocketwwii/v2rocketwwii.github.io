<h1>Why is the V2 Missile so important?</h1>
<tt><p>The German V2 Missile was the first ballistic liquid propellant missile to go into space. It was made under the concentration camps by the prisoners and more than 3,000 missiles were launched.</p>
  <p>The V2 Missile was unique in multiple ways. One thing, it was practically impossible to intercept. Once it's launched, it rises six miles into the air. It then proceeds on an arced course, cutting off its own fuel according to the range set. The rocket then tips over and falls on its target at a speed of approximately 4,000 mph. It hits with a force that the missile lodges itself into the ground several feet before exploding. It it could fly a distance of 200 miles, and the launch pads were portable, making them impossible to detect.</p>
