<br>
<p>Define warhead. A warhead is the explosive head of a missile, torpedo, or similar weapon. We will be talking about warheads on the V2 missile. There are many different types of warheads. Some include; Thermonuclear/Nuclear, Implosion, Controversial, Blast, Fragmentation, Continuous Rod, Shaped Charge, Chemical, and Biological.</p>
<p>Here are the explanations of what each warhead does.</p>
<br>
  <ul>
<li>Explosive: An explosive charge is used to disintegrate the target.</li>
<li>Conventional: Chemicals such as gunpowder and high explosives store significant energy within their molecular bonds. This energy can be released quickly by a trigger.</li>
<li>Blast: A strong shock wave is produced by the explosion of the warhead.</li>
<li>Fragmentation: Metal fragments are exploded, therefor, shooting them at high velocity which causes damage or injury.</li>
<li>Continuous rod: Metal bars welded on their ends form a compact cylinder of rods, which is violently expanded into a contiguous zig-zag-shaped ring by an detination. The rapidly expanding ring produces a cutting effect that is very effective against military aircraft.</li>
<li>Shaped charge: The effect of the explosive charge is focused onto a specially shaped metal liner to project a hypervelocity jet of metal, to perforate heavy armour.</li>
<li>Nuclear: A nuclear fission bombs reaction causes immense energy release.</li>
<li>Chemical: A toxic chemical, such as poison gas, is ejected, which is designed to injure or kill humans.</li>
<li>Biological: An infectious host is dispersed, which is designed to sicken or kill humans.</li>
</ul>
