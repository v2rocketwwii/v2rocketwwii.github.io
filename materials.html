Why is the V2 Rocket So Important?
  <br>
<br>
<p>The rocket was mainly constructed of thin sheet steel, in some sections along a wooden framework. The nose cap was a fuse for detonating the explosive. Underneath the warhead were the instruments, divided into four quadrants which were guidance, control, radio, and electrical. In the center was two half shells containing the aluminum-magnesium alloy propellant tanks, the lox tank below and the larger fuel tank above.</p><p>The lox tank was insulated with glass wool to keep the lox at its desired temperature. The tail section had the motor and the turbopump, steam-generator, and associated plumbing. The motor was made of steel, while the pumps were made of steel with aluminum-silicon alloy impellers and housings.</p><p>The tanks for the hydrogen peroxide and potassium permanganate catalyst for driving the turbopumps were coated inside and out with an aluminum bronze alloy for protection against corrosion.</p>
